## SWE 312 Assignment 2
This Assignment is part of the Software Requirements Engineering course under my bachelor's degree in software engineering

## Assignment Overview
The assignment consists of two main questions:
- Expression of constraints in OCL. Given a class diagram modeling a registration system and asked to express several constraints in OCL.
- Implementation of a birthday book in Java using the Z notation as a specification. The system should support three operations: AddBirthday, FindBirthday, and Remind.
## Question 1: OCL Constraints
For the class diagram provided, we expressed the following constraints in OCL:
- A researcher must submit one manuscript.
- A research must be assigned one submission.
- A paper must have at most 10,000 words.
- Students are not allowed to review any paper.


The solutions to these constraints are provided in the SWE312-Spring23-1.pdf file.
## Question 2: Birthday Book Implementation
Implement the birthday book system in Java, based on the Z notation specification provided. The implementation included the following operations:
- AddBirthday: Add a new name and date to the birthday book.
- FindBirthday: Find the date for a given name in the birthday book.
- Remind: Produce a list of names for which the corresponding date is today.


The Java code for these operations is provided in the BirthdayBook.java file. The input and output for each operation is shown in the SWE312-Spring23-1.pdf file.
## Usage
- Open the SWE312-Spring23-1.pdf file to view the OCL constraints.
- Open the BirthdayBook.java file to view the Java implementation of the birthday book system.
- Open the Screen Shot for Q2 output.png to view the screenshots of the input and output for each operation.
